### Hi there 👋

I’m Tom Hepworth, a UK-based data linker and engineer at the Ministry of Justice. I build tools and infrastructure for entity resolution and record linkage, with a focus on matching systems that work at scale and stand up to real-world data quality issues.

I write about record linkage, data engineering and anything else that takes my fancy at https://tomhepworth.dev.

- **Current:** Data Linking, MoJ - focussed on address matching and building out [uk_address_matcher](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/uk_address_matcher).
