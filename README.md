### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

* I currently work as a Data Engineer in the Ministry of Justice's Criminal Courts domain, where I design and build ELT pipelines and ensure the robustness of our existing methodologies.  
* Previously, I was part of the Ministry of Justice's Data Linking team, where I played a key role in improving and maintaining the open-source linkage software [Splink](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/splink). I also developed extensive data linkage pipelines and infrastructure, leveraging both AWS Glue and DuckDB.
