### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

* I'm currently working on data linking and improving/maintaining the open-source linkage software, [splink](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/splink) at the Ministry of Justice.
* Until I finally merge my two github accounts, my private github can be found [here](https://github.com/th368).
